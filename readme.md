# jQuery Practice

## Learning Objectives

- Use jQuery selectors to select DOM elements
- Prevent form sumissions with `event.preventDefault()`
- Write pseudocode to plan application structure

## Cash Register

Today, we’ll spend time working our way through https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/cash-register

If you’d like to move quicker, check out the bonuses provided in the readme.

Clone down this application, and view the obfuscated solution in a browser:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/cash-register.git
$ cd cash-register/obfuscated
$ open index.html
```

Obfuscated code is provided when we want to show you how an application
works without providing editable javascript.

## You do: Identify the Problem

Spend 10 minutes using the obfuscated solution, and answer the following questions:

> What elements should we create variables for?

> What events should we listen for?

> What elements need to be created?

> How is user input handled?

> What do we need to keep track of?

> What can be calculated from the things we need to keep track of?

## We do: Review answers to above questions

## You do: jQuery API doc dive!

View http://api.jquery.com/ and identify methods that will be useful for this application.

A few things to look for:

- Appending an element to another element
- Updating the HTML for an element
- Reading the HTML from an element
- listening to events
- create a new element
- get value of input

## You do: Complete Pseudocode for this application

## We do: Review Pseudocode

## Break

## You do:
